Instructions
---------

* Challenge time: rest of the day and weekend, until Monday 9am
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Approach
-------

For this challenge I'll start by reading the user stories, and drawing out (by hand) the way that I envision all the units to work together. I'll list the Classes that I'll need, and the methods, and then match the methods to the relevant class. This will give me an idea of what I need to build.
After this I'll create my files, and begin the Red, Green, Refactor approach to writing each part. I'll try to write as many relevant tests as possible as I go.

**BONUS**

Note that is a practice 'tech test' of the kinds that employers use to screen developer applicants.  More detailed submission requirements/guidelines are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
